Assignment: Assignment #2: HTML Basics Practice, Project 2
Date: 9/23/2022
Description: This assignment asks the student to add clearer meaning to the layout of the "Share Your Travels" webpage,
which overuses <div> tags that neither convey semantic value nor coordinate with styling (via class or id
attributes) to compartmentalize various styles of the page's content. SEE MORE DISCUSSION IN THE COMMENTS AT THE BOTTOM
OF THIS PAGE.

In other words, <div> tags might be used effectively to assign CSS selectors to different areas of the webpage;
however, they prove ineffective at communicating useful information about the structure of the page. Semantic tags,
such as <section> or <article>, do a far better job of demarcating the conceptual borders of different portions of a
page. The <section> tag, for instance, delineates a self-contained unit of meaning (e.g., two reviews of Venice that
belong to the conceptual category "reviews"); within the opening and closing <section> tags, there may be numerous
block elements, each with their own styling variations contained by <div> tags (or, put another way, self-contained
units of style). Similarly, the <span> tag, which simply coveys that specific inline styling stretches from the
opening to the closing <span> tags, delineates different styles that many occur within block elements without adding
any meaning to the text that it marks up (though it does change the physical appearance of that text).

While it is often the case that semantic tags do not modify the appearance of webpages, they do offer
tremendous value in terms of how other human beings interpret and interact with those pages. (Notably, adding the
<figure> tags to the original webpage indented the large photograph of Venice and its caption.) If a large webpage were
to contain a legion of unadorned <div> tags (i.e., <div> tags with no useful attributes such as class or id),
development team members would experience greater difficulty maintaining that page in the absence of clear meaningful
markup indicating the concepts each section should convey to the reader. If those team members entered a search query
for, e.g., <article>, in a semantic webpage, they could locate areas in need of revision more quickly than browsing
through a sea of non-expressive <div> tag hits. Semantic webpages also perform better on various levels than pages that
focus strictly on meaningless divisions: loading times, accessibility (because conceptual divisions become easier to
interpret by assistive devices), and search engine optimization (web crawlers can locate content and, in turn, their
associated search engines can, e.g., return hits for memorable quotations that appear within <blockquote> tags but might
overlook the exact same words enclosed in plain vanilla <div> tags). In short, designing a page semantically not only
future-proofs that page against maintenance problems but also adds further benefits of improved speed, audience
inclusivity, and visibility across the World Wide Web.
