Assignment: Assignment #2: HTML Basics Practice, Project 1
Date: 9/23/2022
Description: This assignment reproduces a simple web page depicted in the textbook. The
web page displays the textbook title (h1 heading), the authors' names in emphasized/italic font-style,
a small PNG of the textbook cover hyperlinked to a larger version of the same image, a line of text
describing the subject of the textbook, a hyperlink to the official textbook website, the words "First
Chapters" (h2 heading), and, finally, an ordered list that enumerates the first four chapters of the textbook.

<!--Below are the basic HTML structural tags specified by the textbook, including the !DOCTYPE, html,
head, meta, and body tags.-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport"
          content="width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
    <!--Please note that the graphic of the "Simple Single Page" in the textbook depicts a browser tab
    labeled "Lab 3," which suggests to me that the <title> tag should surround that text. I recognize
    this might be confusing since this document represents Project 1 of Chapter 3, not "Project 3" and
    certainly not "Lab 3." In the interests of adhering to the directions of the assignment, I have
    reproduced that title below, although it may create some initial confusion as to the identity of
    this particular project (1 of 3).-->
