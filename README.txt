Assignment #2: HTML Basics - Writing HTML Code
Course: CIS 235 - Web Programming I
Instructor: Professor Ethel Schuster
Semester: Fall 2022
Date: 27 September 2022

Assistance and Completion Statement: I assert that all files submitted in fulfillment of this assignmeent represent the products of my work and my work, alone.  All files submitted should execute/render as intended. I made use of the W3C Markup Validation Service (https://validator.w3.org/) to assess the validity of the HTML in each assignment file.  I have also provided screenshots of page renderings, validation reports, developer tools, and hyperlink functionality.

I should note that I felt compelled to deviate from the assignment instructions in a few minor ways to adhere to what I understand to be web development best practices:

1. Wherever possible, I constructed hyperlinks using the HTTPS (vs. HTTP) protocol in the interests of security; all links provided by the textbook authors were constructed using the HTTP protocol. In one instance, I replaced a dead link (provided by the textbook authors) with a current, active one.

2. Specific to Project 2: You may find my reflection on the use of semantic vs. non-semantic tags enclosed within comment tags at the top and the bottom of the "ch03-proj2.html" file. I was unable to place the entire text of my reflection at the top of the page because the W3C Markup Validation Service warned me that browsers would need to load too many bytes before reaching the UTF-8 specification in the <meta> tag.  Accordingly, I split the comment text up into two parts.

3. Specific to Project 3: The art gallery information provided by the textbook authors did not contain any data about the "Highlight" images, so I verfied the titles of the various artworks and their creators and included that information as alt attributes for each image.

4. Specific to Project 3: I have included a brief CSS file to help control the look of the page and to minimize the impact that smaller screens might have on how the rows of images break.

5. Specific to Project 3: Out of concern for loading times on mobile devices, I have provided a set of smaller images to accompany the large header graphics, and I have employed the <picture> tag to load the smaller, alternate versions of those images on devices with narrower screens.
